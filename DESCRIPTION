Title: STANE: Spatial transcriptomic analysis considering niche effects in the tumor microenvironment
Version: 0.1.0
Author: ZHANG, Xiaomeng
Maintainer: The package maintainer <xzhangew@connect.ust.hk>
Description: This package uses cell type-specific expression information as reference to deconvolute
    spatial transcriptomics data while considering niche effects through cell-cell interactions.
    For one sample with spatial sequencing data, the package provides spot-level estimated cell type-
    specific proportions as well as differential expressed genes caused by niche effects from neighbor
    cells in the microenvironment.
